Probability forms the foundation for almost all treatments of statistical inference.
In our treatment, probability is a law that assigns numbers to the long run occurrence of random phenomena after repeated unrelated realizations.

Before we begin discussing probability, let's dispense with some deep philosophical questions, such as "What is randomness?" and "What is the fundamental interpretation of probability?". One could spend a lifetime studying these questions (and some have). For our purposes, randomness is any process occurring without apparent deterministic patterns. Thus we will treat many things as if they were random when, in fact they are completely deterministic. In my field, biostatistics, we often model disease outcomes as if they were random when they are the result of many mechanistic components whose aggregate behavior appears random. Probability for us will be the long run proportion of times some occurs in repeated unrelated realizations. So, think of the proportion of times that you get a head when flipping a coin.

For the interested student, I would recommend the books and work by Ian Hacking to learn more about these deep philosophical issues. For us data scientists, the above definitions will work fine.


## Where to get a more thorough treatment of  probability

In this lecture, we will cover the fundamentals of probability at low enough of
a level to have a basic understanding for the rest of the series. For a more
complete treatment see the class Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp 1, which
can be viewed on YouTube [here](Youtube:
www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpl-gQkQivXhk6qSyiNj51qamjAtZISJ-).  In addition,
there's  the actual [Coursera course](Coursera:
www.coursera.org/course/biostats) that I run periodically (this is the first
Coursera class that I ever taught).  Also there are a set of [notes on
GitHub](http://github.com/bcaffo/Caffo-Coursera). Finally, there's a follow up
class, uninspiringly named  Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp 2, that is more
devoted  to biostatistical topics that has an associated [YouTube

## Kolmogorov's Three Rules

[Watch this lecture before
beginning.](http://youtu.be/Shzt9uZ8BII?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ)

Given a random experiment (say rolling a die) a probability measure is a
population quantity
 that summarizes the randomness.  The brilliant discovery of
the father of probability, the [Russian mathematician
Kolmogorov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov), was that
 to
satisfy our intuition about how probability should behave, only three rules were
needed.

Consider an experiment with a random outcome. Probability takes a possible
outcome from an experiment and:

1. assigns it a number between 0 and 1
2. requires that the probability that
something occurs is 1
3. required that the probability of the union of any two
sets of outcomes that have nothing in common (mutually exclusive)
 is the sum of
their respective probabilities.

From these simple rules all of the familiar rules of probability can be
developed.  This all might seem a little odd at first and so we'll build up our
intuition with some simple examples based on coin flipping and die rolling.

I would like to reiterate the important definition that we wrote out: *mutually
exclusive*.  Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot both
simultaneously occur. For example, we cannot simultaneously get a 1 and a 2 on a
die.  Rule 3 says that since the event of getting a 1 and 2 on a die are
mutually exclusive, the probability of getting at least one (the union) is the
sum of their probabilities. So if we know that the probability of getting a 1 is
1/6 and the probability of getting a 2 is 1/6, then the probability of getting a
1 or a 2 is 2/6, the sum of the two probabilities since they are mutually
exclusive.

## Consequences of The Three Rules

Let's cover some consequences of our three simple rules.  Take, for example, the
probability that something occurs is 1 minus the probability of the opposite
occurring.  Let {$$}A{/$$} be the event that we get a 1 or a 2 on a rolled die.
Then {$$}A^c{/$$} is the opposite, getting a 3, 4, 5 or 6. Since {$$}A{/$$} and
{$$}A^c{/$$}
cannot both simultaneously occur, they are mutually exclusive. So
the probability that either {$$}A{/$$} or {$$}A^c{/$$}  is {$$}P(A) + P(A^c){/$$}.
Notice, that the probability that either occurs is the probability
of getting a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, or in other words, the probability that
something occurs, which is 1 by rule number 2.  So we have that
{$$}1 = P(A) + P(A^c){/$$} or that {$$}P(A) = 1 - P(A^c){/$$}.

We won't go through this tedious exercise (since Kolmogorov already did it for
us). Instead here's a list of some of the consequences of Kolmogorov's rules
that are often useful.

1. The probability that nothing occurs is 0
2. The probability that something occurs is 1
3.  The probability of something is 1 minus the probability that the opposite occurs
4.  The probability of at least one of two (or more) things that can not simultaneously occur (mutually exclusive)  is the sum of their respective probabilities
5. For any two events the probability that at least one occurs is the sum of their probabilities minus their intersection.

This last rules states that {$$}P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)  - P(A \cap B){/$$}
shows what is the issue with adding probabilities that are not mutually
exclusive.  If we do this, we've added the probability that both occur in twice!
(Watch the video where I draw a Venn diagram to illustrate this).

### Example of Implementing Probability Calculus

The National Sleep Foundation
([www.sleepfoundation.org](http://www.sleepfoundation.org/)) reports that around
3% of the American population has sleep apnea. They also report that around 10%
of the North American and European population has restless leg syndrome. Does
this imply that 13% of people will have at least one sleep problems of these
sorts? In other words, can we simply add these two
 probabilities?

Answer: No, the events can simultaneously occur and so
 are not mutually
exclusive. To elaborate let:

{$$}
 \begin{eqnarray*}
     A_1 & = & \{\mbox{Person has sleep apnea}\} \\
A_2 & = & \{\mbox{Person has RLS}\}
   \end{eqnarray*}
 {/$$}

Then

{$$}
 \begin{eqnarray*}
     P(A_1 \cup A_2 ) & = & P(A_1) + P(A_2) - P(A_1 \cap
A_2) \\
    & = & 0.13 - \mbox{Probability of having both}
   \end{eqnarray*}
 {/$$}

Given the scenario, it's likely that some fraction of the population has both.
This example serves as a reminder *don't add probabilities unless the events are
mutually exclusive*. We'll have a similar rule for multiplying probabilities and
independence.

## Random variables
[Watch this video before reading this section](http://youtu.be/Shzt9uZ8BII?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ)

Probability calculus is useful for understanding the rules that probabilities must follow. However, we need ways to model and think about probabilities for
numeric outcomes of experiments (broadly defined).
 Densities and mass functions
for random variables are the best starting point for this. You've already
 heard
of a density since  you've heard of the famous "bell curve", or Gaussian
density. In this section
 you'll learn exactly what the bell curve is and how to
work with it.

Remember, everything we're talking about up to at this point is a population
quantity,
 not a statement about what occurs in our data. Think about the fact that
50% probability for head is a statement about
 the coin and how we're flipping
it, not a statement about the percentage of heads we obtained in a particular
set of flips.  This is an important distinction that we will emphasize over and
over in this course. Statistical
 inference is about describing populations
using data. Probability density functions are a way to mathematically
characterize the population. In this course, we'll assume that our sample is a
random draw from the population.

So our definition is that a **random variable** is a numerical outcome of an
experiment.
 The random variables that we study will come in two varieties,
**discrete** or **continuous**. Discrete random variables are random variables
that take on only a
 countable number of possibilities. Mass functions will
assign probabilities that they
 take specific values.  Continuous random
variable can conceptually take any value on the real line or
 some subset of the
real line and we talk about the probability that they lie within some range.
Densities
 will characterize these probabilities.

Let's consider some examples of measurements that could be considered random variables.
First, familiar gambling experiments like the tossing of a coin and the rolling
of a die produce random variables. For the coin, we typically code a tail as
a 0 and a head as a 1. (For the die, the number facing up would be the random
variable.) We will use these examples a lot to help us build intuition. However,
they aren't interesting in the sense of seeming very contrived. Nonetheless,
the coin example is particularly useful since many of the experiments we
consider will be modeled as if tossing a biased coin. Modeling
any binary characteristic from a random sample of a population can be
thought of as a coin toss, with the random sampling performing the roll of the
toss and the population percentage of individuals with the characteristic
is the probability of a head. Consider, for example, logging whether or
not subjects were hypertensive in a random sample. Each subject's
outcome can be modeled as a coin toss. In a similar sense the die roll serves
as our model for phenomena with more than one level, such as hair color or
rating scales.

Consider also the random variable of the number of web hits for a site each day.
This variable is a count, but is largely unbounded (or at least we couldn't
put a specific reasonable upper limit). Random variables like this are often modeled
with the so called Poisson distribution.

Finally, consider some continuous random variables. Think of things like
lengths or weights. It is mathematically convenient to model these
as if they were continuous (even if measurements were truncated liberally).
In fact, even discrete random variables with lots of levels are often
treated as continuous for convenience.  

For all of these kinds of random variables, we need convenient mathematical
functions to model the probabilities of collections of realizations. These
functions, called mass functions and densities,
take possible values of the random variables, and assign the associated
probabilities. These entities describe the population of interest. So, consider
the most famous density, the normal distribution. Saying that body mass
indices follow a normal distribution is a statement about the population of
interest. The goal is to use our data to figure out things about that normal
distribution, where it's centered, how spread out it is and even
whether our assumption of normality is warranted!

## Probability mass functions

A probability mass function evaluated at a value corresponds to the
 probability
that a random variable takes that value. To be a valid pmf a function, {$$}p{/$$},
must satisfy:

1. It must always be larger than or equal to 0.
2. The sum of the possible values that the random variable can take has to add up to one.


### Example

Let {$$}X{/$$} be the result of a coin flip where {$$}X=0{/$$}
represents tails and {$$}X = 1{/$$}
represents heads. {$$}p(x) = (1/2)^{x} (1/2)^{1-x}{/$$}
for {$$}x = 0,1{/$$}.
Suppose that we do not know whether or not the coin is fair; Let
 {$$}\theta{/$$} be
the probability of a head expressed as a proportion
 (between 0 and 1).
{$$}p(x) = \theta^{x} (1 - \theta)^{1-x} {/$$}
for {$$}x = 0,1 {/$$}

## Probability density functions

[Watch this video before beginning.](http://youtu.be/mPe0Us4VYDM?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ)

A probability density function (pdf), is a function associated with a continuous
random variable. Because of the peculiarities
of treating measurements as having been recorded to infinite
decimal expansions, we need a different set of rules. This
leads us to the central dogma of probability density functions:

*Areas under PDFs correspond to probabilities for that random variable*

Therefore, when one says that intelligence quotients (IQ) in population follows a bell
curve, they are saying that the probability of a randomly
selected person from this population having an IQ between
two values is given by the area under the bell curve.

Not every function can be a valid probability density
function. For example, if the function dips below zero,
then we could have negative probabilities. If the function
contains too much area underneath it, we could have
probabilities larger than one. The following two
rules tell us when a function is a valid probability
density function.

Specifically, to be a valid pdf, a function must satisfy

1. It must be larger than or equal to zero everywhere.
2. The total area under it must be one.

### Example

Suppose that the proportion of help calls that get addressed in
a random day by a help line is given by {$$} f(x) = 2 x {/$$}
for {$$}0< x < 1{/$$}. The R code for plotting this density is

{title="Code for plotting the density", line-numbers=off,lang=r}
~~~~~~
x <- c(-0.5, 0, 1, 1, 1.5)
y <- c(0, 0, 2, 0, 0)
plot(x, y, lwd = 3,frame = FALSE, type = "l")
~~~~~~

The result of the code is given below.

![Help call density](images/triangleDensity.png)

Is this a mathematically valid density? To answer this
we need to make sure it satisfies our two conditions.
First it's clearly nonnegative (it's at or above
the horizontal axis everywhere). The area is similarly
easy. Being a right triangle in the only section of the
density that is above zero, we can calculate it as
1/2 the area of the base times the height. This
is {$$}\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 2 = 1{/$$}


Now consider answering the following question.
What is the probability that 75% or fewer of calls get addressed?
Remember, for continuous random variables, probabilities are represented
by areas underneath the density function. So, we want the area from
0.75 and below, as illustrated by the figure below.

![Help call density](images/triangleDensityArea.png)

This again is a right triangle, with length of the base as 0.75
and height 1.5. The R code below shows the calculation.

{line-numbers=off,lang=r}
~~~~~~
> 1.5 * 0.75/2

[1] 0.5625
~~~~~~

Thus, the probability of 75% or fewer calls getting addressed in a random
day for this help line is 56%. We'll do this a lot throughout this class
and work with more useful densities. It should be noted that this specific
density is a special case of the so called *beta* density. Below I show how
to use R's built in evaluation function for the beta density to get the
probability.

{line-numbers=off,lang=r}
~~~~~~

> pbeta(0.75, 2, 1)

[1] 0.5625
~~~~~~

Notice the syntax `pbeta`. In R, a prefix of `p` returns probabilities,
`d` returns the density, `q` returns the quantile and `r` returns generated
random variables. (You'll learn what each of these does in subsequent sections.)

## CDF and survival function

Certain areas of PDFs and PMFs are so useful, we give them names.
The **cumulative distribution function** (CDF) of a random variable, {$$}X{/$$},
returns the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to the
value {$$}x{/$$}. Notice the (slightly annoying) convention that we use an upper
case {$$}X{/$$} to denote a random, unrealized, version of the random variable
and a lowercase {$$}x{/$$} to denote a specific number that we plug into.
(This notation, as odd as it may seem, dates back to Fisher and isn't going
anywhere, so you might as well get used to it. Uppercase for unrealized random
variables and lowercase as placeholders for numbers to plug into.) So we
could write the following to describe the distribution function
{$$}F{/$$}:


{$$}
F(x) = P(X \leq x)
{/$$}

This definition applies regardless of  
whether the random variable is discrete or continuous. The **survival function**
of a random variable {$$}X{/$$} is defined as the
probability that the random variable is greater than the value {$$}x{/$$}.

{$$}
S(x) = P(X > x)
{/$$}

 Notice that {$$}S(x) = 1 - F(x){/$$}, since the survival function evaluated
 at a particular value of {$$}x{/$$} is calculating the probability of the
 opposite event (greater than as opposed to less than or equal to). The
 survival function is often preferred in biostatistical applications while
 the  distribution function is more generally used (though both convey the
 same  information.)


### Example

What are the survival function and CDF from the density considered before?

{$$}
F(x) = P(X \leq x) = \frac{1}{2} Base \times Height = \frac{1}{2} (x) \times (2 x) = x^2,
{/$$}

for {$$}1 \geq x \geq 0{/$$}. Notice that calculating the survival function
is now trivial given that we've already calculated the distribution function.

{$$}
 S(x) = 1 = F(x) = 1 - x^2
{/$$}

Again, R has a function that calculates the distribution function for us
in this case, `pbeta`. Let's try calculating {$$}F(.4){/$$}, {$$}F(.5){/$$}
and {$$}F(.6){/$$}

{line-numbers=off,lang=r}
~~~~~~
> pbeta(c(0.4, 0.5, 0.6), 2, 1)

[1] 0.16 0.25 0.36
 ~~~~~~

Notice, of course, these are simply the numbers squared. By default the prefix
`p` in front of a density in R gives the distribution function (`pbeta`, `pnorm`,
  `pgamma`). If you want the survival function values, you could always subtract
  by one, or give the argument `lower.tail = FALSE` as an argument to the function,
  which asks R to calculate the upper area instead of the lower.

## Quantiles

You've heard of sample quantiles. If you were the 95th percentile on an exam, you know
that 95% of people scored worse than you and 5% scored better.
These are sample quantities. But you might have wondered, what are my sample
quantiles estimating? In fact, they are estimating the population quantiles.
Here we define these population analogs.  


The  {$$}\alpha^{th}{/$$} **quantile** of a distribution
with distribution function {$$}F{/$$} is the point {$$}x_\alpha{/$$} so that

{$$}
F(x_\alpha) = \alpha
{/$$}

So the 0.95 quantile of a distribution is the point so that 95% of the mass
of the density lies below it. Or, in other words, the point so that the
probability of getting a randomly sampled point below it is 0.95. This is
analogous to the sample
quantiles where the 0.95 sample quantile is the value so that 95% of the data
lies below it.

 A **percentile** is simply a quantile with {$$}\alpha{/$$} expressed as a percent
 rather than a proportion.  The (population)
**median** is the {$$}50^{th}{/$$} percentile. Remember that percentiles
are not probabilities! Remember that quantiles have units. So the population
median height is the height (in inches say) so that the probability that a randomly selected
person from the population is shorter is 50%. The sample, or empirical,
median would be the height so in a sample so that 50% of the people in the
sample were shorter.

### Example
What is the median of the distribution that we were working with before?
We want to solve {$$}0.5 = F(x) = x^2{/$$}, resulting in the solution

{line-numbers=off,lang=r}
~~~~~~
> sqrt(0.5)

[1] 0.7071
~~~~~~

Therefore, 0.7071 of calls being answered on a random day is the median.
Or, the probability that 70% or fewer calls get answered is 50%.

R can approximate quantiles for you for common distributions with the
prefix `q` in front of the distribution name

{line-numbers=off,lang=r}
~~~~~~
> qbeta(0.5, 2, 1)

[1] 0.7071
~~~~~~

## Exercises

2. I define a PMF, {$$}p{/$$} so that for {$$}x = 0{/$$} and {$$}x=1{/$$} we have
