Power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.
Ergo, power (as its name would suggest) is a good thing; you want more power.
A type II error (a bad thing, as its name would suggest) is failing to reject
the null hypothesis when it's false; the probability of a type II error is
usually called $\beta$. Note Power  $= 1 - \beta$.

Let's go through an example of calculating power.
Consider our previous example involving RDI.
$H_0: \mu = 30$ versus $H_a: \mu > 30$.
Then power is:

$$P\left(\frac{\bar X - 30}{s /\sqrt{n}} > t_{1-\alpha,n-1} ~;~ \mu = \mu_a \right).$$

Note that this is a function that depends on the specific value of $\mu_a$!
Further notice that as $\mu_a$ approaches 30 the power approaches $\alpha$.


Pushing this example further, we reject if

$$Z = \frac{\bar X - 30}{\sigma /\sqrt{n}} > z_{1-\alpha}$$

Or, equivalently, if

$$\bar X > 30 + Z_{1-\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

But, note that, under $H_0 : \bar X \sim N(\mu_0, \sigma^2 / n)$.
However, under $H_a : \bar X \sim N(\mu_a, \sigma^2 / n)$.

So for this test we could calculate power with this R code:


```{r title="Power calculation for the sleep example in R", echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
alpha = 0.05
mu0 = 30; mua = 32; n = 16; sigma = 4
z = qnorm(1 - alpha)
pnorm(mu0 + z * sigma/sqrt(n), mean = mua, sd = sigma/sqrt(n),
      lower.tail = FALSE)
```


Let's plug in the specific numbers for our example where:
$\mu_a = 32$, $\mu_0 = 30$, $n =16$, $\sigma = 4$.


```{r , echo=TRUE}
mu0 = 30
mua = 32
sigma = 4
n = 16
z = qnorm(1 - alpha)
pnorm(mu0 + z * sigma/sqrt(n), mean = mu0, sd = sigma/sqrt(n),
      lower.tail = FALSE)

pnorm(mu0 + z * sigma/sqrt(n), mean = mua, sd = sigma/sqrt(n),
      lower.tail = FALSE)
```


When we plug in $\mu_0$, the value under the null hypothesis, we
get that the probability of rejection is 5%, as the test was designed. However,
when we plug in a value of 32, we get 64%. Therefore, the probability of
rejection is 64% when the true value of $\mu$ is 32. We could create
a curve of the power as a function of $\mu_a$, as seen below.
We also varied the sample size to see how the curve depends on that.

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Plot of power as $\\mu_a$ varies.", label = "powerCurve", fig.height=3.5}
library(ggplot2)
nseq = c(8, 16, 32, 64, 128)
mua = seq(30, 35, by = 0.1)
z = qnorm(.95)
power = sapply(nseq, function(n)
pnorm(mu0 + z * sigma / sqrt(n), mean = mua,
      sd = sigma / sqrt(n), 
          lower.tail = FALSE))
colnames(power) <- paste("n", nseq, sep = "")
d <- data.frame(mua, power)
library(reshape2)
d2 <- melt(d, id.vars = "mua")
names(d2) <- c("mua", "n", "power")    
g <- ggplot(d2, aes(x = mua, y = power, col = n)) +
  geom_line(size = 2)
g        
```


The code below shows how to use manipulate to investigate power
as the various inputs change.


```{r title="Code for investigating power.", echo=TRUE, fig.keep='none'}
library(manipulate)
mu0 = 30
myplot <- function(sigma, mua, n, alpha) {
    g = ggplot(data.frame(mu = c(27, 36)), aes(x = mu))
    g = g + stat_function(fun = dnorm, geom = "line",
                          args = list(mean = mu0,
        sd = sigma/sqrt(n)), size = 2, col = "red")
    g = g + stat_function(fun = dnorm, geom = "line",
                          args = list(mean = mua,
        sd = sigma/sqrt(n)), size = 2, col = "blue")
    xitc = mu0 + qnorm(1 - alpha) * sigma/sqrt(n)
    g = g + geom_vline(xintercept = xitc, size = 3)
    g
}
manipulate(myplot(sigma, mua, n, alpha),
           sigma = slider(1, 10, step = 1, initial = 4),
    mua = slider(30, 35, step = 1, initial = 32),
    n = slider(1, 50, step = 1, initial = 16),
    alpha = slider(0.01, 0.1, step = 0.01, initial = 0.05))
```


## Question
[Watch this video before beginning.](http://youtu.be/3bWhP5MyuqI?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ)

 When testing $H_a : \mu > \mu_0$, notice if power is $1 - \beta$, then

$$1 - \beta = P\left(\bar X > \mu_0 + z_{1-\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} ; \mu = \mu_a \right)$$

where $\bar X \sim N(\mu_a, \sigma^2 / n)$. The
unknowns in the equation are: $\mu_a$, $\sigma$, $n$,
$\beta$ and the knowns are: $\mu_0$, $\alpha$.
Specify any 3 of the unknowns and you can solve for the remainder.

## Notes
- The calculation for $H_a:\mu < \mu_0$ is similar
- For $H_a: \mu \neq \mu_0$ calculate the one sided power using
  $\alpha / 2$ (this is only approximately right, it excludes the probability of
  getting a large TS in the opposite direction of the truth)
- Power goes up as $\alpha$ gets larger
- Power of a one sided test is greater than the power of the
  associated two sided test
- Power goes up as $\mu_1$ gets further away from $\mu_0$
- Power goes up as $n$ goes up
- Power doesn't need $\mu_a$, $\sigma$ and $n$, instead only $\frac{\sqrt{n}(\mu_a - \mu_0)}{\sigma}$
  - The quantity $\frac{\mu_a - \mu_0}{\sigma}$ is called the *effect size*, the difference in the means in standard deviation units.
  - Being unit free, it has some hope of interpretability across settings.

## T-test power
[Watch this before beginning.](http://youtu.be/1DiwutNpt5Y?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ)

Consider calculating power for a Gosset's *t* test for our example where
we now assume that $n=16$. The power is

$$
P\left(\frac{\bar X - \mu_0}{S /\sqrt{n}} > t_{1-\alpha, n-1} ~;~ \mu = \mu_a \right).
$$

Calculating this requires the so-called non-central t distribution.
However, fortunately for us, the R function `power.t.test` does this very well.
Omit (exactly) any one of the arguments and it solves for it. Our t-test
power again only relies on the effect size.

Let's do our example trying different options.


```{r title="Example of using 'power.t.test' in R.", echo=TRUE}
# omitting the power and getting a power estimate
power.t.test(n = 16, delta = 2/4, sd = 1,
             type = "one.sample", alt = "one.sided")$power

# illustrating that it depends only on the effect size, delta/sd
power.t.test(n = 16, delta = 2, sd = 4,
             type = "one.sample", alt = "one.sided")$power

# same thing again
power.t.test(n = 16, delta = 100, sd = 200,
             type = "one.sample", alt = "one.sided")$power

# specifying the power and getting n
power.t.test(power = 0.8, delta = 2/4, sd = 1,
             type = "one.sample", alt = "one.sided")$n

# again illustrating that the effect size is all that matters
power.t.test(power = 0.8, delta = 2, sd = 4,
             type = "one.sample", alt = "one.sided")$n

# again illustrating that the effect size is all that matters
power.t.test(power = 0.8, delta = 100, sd = 200,
             type = "one.sample", alt = "one.sided")$n
```

Assuming a common standard deviation of 4 purchases per day." Assuming that 10 purchases per day is a benchmark null value,
that days are iid and that the standard deviation is 4 purchases for day. Suppose that you
