# Some common distributions


## The Bernoulli distribution

The **Bernoulli distribution** arises as the result of a binary outcome, such
as a coin flip. Thus, Bernoulli random variables take (only)
the values 1 and 0 with probabilities of (say) {$$}p{/$$} and {$$}1-p{/$$},
respectively. Recall that the
PMF for a Bernoulli random variable {$$}X{/$$} is
{$$}P(X = x) =  p^x (1 - p)^{1 - x}{/$$}.

The mean of a Bernoulli random variable is {$$}p{/$$} and the variance is
{$$}p(1 - p){/$$}. If we let {$$}X{/$$} be a Bernoulli random variable,
it is typical to call {$$}X=1{/$$} as a "success" and {$$}X=0{/$$} as a "failure".

If a random variable follows a Bernoulli distribution with success probability
{$$}p{/$$} we write that {$$}X \sim {/$$} Bernoulli{$$}(p){/$$}.

Bernoulli random variables are commonly used for modeling any binary trait
for a random sample. So, for example, in a random sample whether or not
a participant has high blood pressure would be reasonably modeled as Bernoulli.



## Binomial trials

The **binomial random variables** are obtained as the sum of iid Bernoulli trials.
So if a Bernoulli trial is the result of a coin flip, a binomial random variable
is the total number of heads.

To write it out as mathematics, let {$$}X_1,\ldots,X_n{/$$} be iid
Bernoulli{$$}(p){/$$}, then {$$}X = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i{/$$} is a
binomial random variable. We write out that
{$$}X \sim {/$$} Binomial{$$}(n,p){/$$}. The binomial mass function is

{$$}
P(X = x) =
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  n \\ x
\end{array}
\right)
p^x(1 - p)^{n-x}
{/$$}

where {$$}x=0,\ldots,n{/$$}. Recall that the notation

{$$}
\left(
  \begin{array}{c} n \\ x \end{array}
\right) = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}
{/$$}

(read "{$$}n{/$$} choose {$$}x{/$$}") counts the number of ways of
selecting {$$}x{/$$} items out of {$$}n{/$$}
without replacement disregarding the order of the items. It turns out
that {$$}n{/$$} choose 0 is 1 and {$$}n{/$$} choose 1 and
{$$}n{/$$} choose {$$}n-1{/$$} are both {$$}n{/$$}.

### Example

Suppose a friend has 8 children, {$$}7{/$$} of which are girls and none are
twins. If each gender has an independent {$$}50{/$$}% probability for each
birth, what's the probability of getting {$$}7{/$$} or more girls out of
{$$}8{/$$} births?

{$$}
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  8 \\ 7
\end{array}
\right) .5^{7}(1-.5)^{1}
+
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  8 \\ 8
\end{array}
\right) .5^{8}(1-.5)^{0} \approx 0.04 .

## The normal distribution
[Watch this video before beginning](http://youtu.be/dUTWvKa0Leo?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ)

The normal distribution is easily the handiest distribution in all of
statistics. It can be used in an endless variety of settings. Moreover,
as we'll see later on in the course, sample means follow normal distributions
 for large sample sizes.

Remember the goal of probability modeling. We are assuming a probability
distribution for our population as a way of parsimoniously characterizing
it. In fact, the normal distribution only requires two numbers to characterize
it. Specifically,
a random variable is said to follow a **normal** or **Gaussian**
distribution with mean {$$}\mu{/$$} and variance {$$}\sigma^2{/$$}
if the associated  density is:

{$$}
 (2\pi \sigma^2)^{-1/2}e^{-(x - \mu)^2/2\sigma^2}.
{/$$}

If {$$}X{/$$} is a RV with this density then {$$}E[X] = \mu{/$$} and
{$$}Var(X) = \sigma^2{/$$}. That is, the normal distribution is characterized
by the mean and variance.  We write {$$}X\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2){/$$} to denote
a normal random variable.  When {$$}\mu = 0{/$$} and {$$}\sigma = 1{/$$}
the resulting distribution is called **the standard normal distribution**.
Standard normal RVs are often labeled {$$}Z{/$$}

Consider an example, if we say that intelligence quotients are normally
distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Then, we
are saying that if we randomly sample a person from this population, the
probability that they have an IQ of say 120 or larger, is governed by a
normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a variance of {$$}15^2{/$$}.

Taken another way, if we know that the population is normally distributed
then to estimate everything about the population, we need only estimate
the population mean and variance. (Estimated by the sample mean and
  the sample variance.)


### Reference quantiles for the standard normal
The normal distribution is so important that it is useful to memorize
reference probabilities and quantiles. The image below shows reference lines
at 0, 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations above and below 0. This is for the standard
normal; however, all of the rules apply to non standard normals as 0, 1, 2
and 3 standard deviations above and below {$$}\mu{/$$}, the population mean.

![Standard normal reference lines.](images/normalReference.png)

The most relevant probabilities are.

1. Approximately 68\%, 95\% and 99\%  of the normal density lies within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations from the mean, respectively.
2. -1.28, -1.645, -1.96 and -2.33 are the {$$}10^{th}{/$$}, {$$}5^{th}{/$$},
{$$}2.5^{th}{/$$} and {$$}1^{st}{/$$} percentiles of the standard normal
distribution, respectively.
3. By symmetry, 1.28, 1.645, 1.96 and 2.33 are the {$$}90^{th}{/$$},
{$$}95^{th}{/$$}, {$$}97.5^{th}{/$$} and {$$}99^{th}{/$$} percentiles of the
standard normal distribution, respectively.



### Shifting and scaling normals

Since the  normal distribution is characterized by only the mean and variance,
which are a shift and a scale, we can transform normal random variables to
be standard normals and vice versa. For example If
{$$}X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2){/$$} then:

{$$}Z = \frac{X -\mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0, 1).{/$$}

If {$$}Z{/$$} is standard normal

{$$}X = \mu + \sigma Z \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2){/$$}

then {$$}X{/$$} is {$$}X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2){/$$}. We can use these facts
to answer questions about non-standard normals by relating them back to
the standard normal.



### Example

What is the {$$}95^{th}{/$$} percentile of a {$$}N(\mu, \sigma^2){/$$} distribution?
Quick answer in R `qnorm(.95, mean = mu, sd = sigma)`. Alternatively, because
we have the standard normal quantiles memorized,
and we know that 1.645 is its 95th percentile,  the answer has to be
{$$}\mu + \sigma 1.645{/$$}.

In general, {$$}\mu + \sigma z_0{/$$} where {$$}z_0{/$$}
is the appropriate standard normal quantile.

To put some context on our previous setting, population
mean BMI for men [is reported as](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23675464)
29 {$$}kg/mg^2{/$$} with a
standard deviation of 4.73. Assuming normality of BMI, what is the population
{$$}95^{th}{/$$} percentile? The answer is then:

{$$}
29 + 4.73 \times 1.645 = 36.78.
{/$$}

Or alternatively, we could simply type `r qnorm(.95, 29, 4.73)` in R.

Now let's reverse the process. Imagine asking what's the probability that
a randomly drawn subject from this population has a BMI less than 24.27?
Notice that

{$$}
\frac{24.27 - 29}{4.73} = -1.
{/$$}

Therefore, 24.27 is 1 standard deviation below the mean. We know that 16% lies
below or above 1 standard deviation from the mean. Thus 16% lies below.
Alternatively, `pnorm(24.27, 29, 4.73)` yields the result.

### Example

Assume that the number of daily ad clicks for a company
is (approximately) normally distributed with a mean of 1020 and a standard
deviation of 50. What's the probability of getting
more than  1,160 clicks in a day? Notice that:

{$$}
\frac{1160 - 1020}{50} = 2.8
{/$$}

Therefore, 1,160 is 2.8 standard deviations above the mean. We know from our
standard normal quantiles that the probability of being larger
than 2 standard deviation is 2.5% and 3 standard deviations is far in the tail.
Therefore, we know that the probability has to be smaller than 2.5% and should
be very small. We can obtain it
exactly as `r pnorm(1160, 1020, 50, lower.tail = FALSE)` which is 0.3%. Note
that we can also obtain the probability as `r pnorm(2.8, lower.tail = FALSE)`.

### Example
Consider the previous example again. What number of daily ad clicks
would represent
the one where 75% of days have fewer clicks (assuming
days are independent and identically distributed)? We can obtain this as:

## The Poisson distribution
[Watch this video before beginning.](http://youtu.be/ZPLZg7qz4xE?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ)

The Poisson distribution is used to model counts. It is perhaps only second
to the normal distribution in usefulness. In fact, the Bernoulli, binomial
and multinomial distributions can all be modeled by clever uses of the
Poisson.

The Poisson distribution is especially useful for modeling unbounded
counts or counts per unit of time (rates).
Like the number of clicks on advertisements, or the number of
people who show up at a bus stop. (While these are in principle bounded,
it would be hard to actually put an upper limit on it.) There is
also a deep connection between the Poisson distribution and popular models
for so-called event-time data. In addition, the Poisson distribution is
the default model for so-called contingency table data, which is simply
tabulations of discrete characteristics. Finally, when {$$}n{/$$} is large
and {$$}p{/$$} is small, the Poisson is an accurate approximation to the
binomial distribution.

The Poisson mass function is:

{$$}
P(X = x; \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}
{/$$}

for {$$}x=0,1,\ldots{/$$}. The mean of this distribution is
{$$}\lambda{/$$}. The variance of this distribution is also {$$}\lambda{/$$}.
Notice that {$$}x{/$$} ranges from 0 to {$$}\infty{/$$}. Therefore,
the Poisson distribution is especially useful for modeling unbounded counts.

### Rates and Poisson random variables
The Poisson distribution is useful for rates, counts that occur
over units of time. Specifically, if  {$$}X \sim Poisson(\lambda t){/$$}
where {$$}\lambda = E[X / t]{/$$} is the expected count per unit of time
and {$$}t{/$$} is the total monitoring time.

### Example
The number of people that show up at a bus stop is Poisson with
a mean of 2.5 per hour. If watching the bus stop for 4 hours, what
is the probability that $3$ or fewer people show up for the whole time?


{title="Finding a normal quantile", line-numbers=off,lang=r}
~~~
> ppois(3, lambda = 2.5 * 4)
[1] 0.01034
~~~

Therefore, there is about a 1% chance that 3 or fewer people show up. Notice
the multiplication by four in the function argument. Since lambda is
specified as events per *hour* we have to multiply by four to consider the
number of events that occur in 4 hours.

### Poisson approximation to the binomial
When {$$}n{/$$} is large and {$$}p{/$$} is small the Poisson distribution
is an accurate approximation to the binomial distribution. Formally, if
{$$}X \sim \mbox{Binomial}(n, p){/$$} then {$$}X{/$$} is approximately
Poisson where {$$}\lambda = n p{/$$} provided that {$$}n{/$$} is large
{$$}p{/$$} is small.

#### Example, Poisson approximation to the binomial

We flip a coin with success probability 0.01 five hundred times.
What's the probability of 2 or fewer successes?


{title="Finding a normal quantile", line-numbers=off,lang=r}
~~~
> pbinom(2, size = 500, prob = 0.01)
[1] 0.1234
> ppois(2, lambda = 500 * 0.01)
[1] 0.1247
~~~

So we can see that the probabilities agree quite well. This approximation is
often done as the Poisson model is a more convenient model in many respects.

## Exercises
1. Your friend claims that changing the font to comic sans will result in more ad revenue on your web sites. When presented in random order, 9 pages out of 10 had more revenue when the font was set to comic sans. If it was really a coin flip for these 10 sites, what's the probability of getting 9 or 10 out of 10 with more revenue for the new font?
2. A software company is doing an analysis of documentation errors of their products.
