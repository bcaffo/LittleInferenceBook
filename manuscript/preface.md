## About this book
This book is written as a companion book to the [Statistical Inference](https://www.coursera.org/course/statinference)
Coursera class as part of the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=courseDescripTop). However, if you do not take the class, the book stands on its own. A
useful component of the book is a series of YouTube videos that comprise the
Coursera class.

The book is intended to be a low cost introduction to the important field of
statistical inference. The intended audience are students who have numerically
and computationally literate, who would like to put those skills to use in
Data Science or Statistics. The book is offered for free as a series of
markdown documents on github and in more convenient forms (epub, mobi) on
Leanpub and retail outlets.
